                            These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services. Please read these Terms carefully, as they
                            include important information about your legal rights. By accessing and/or using the Services, you are
                            agreeing to these Terms. If you do not understand or agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.

                            1.1 <strong>Description of the Services.</strong> The Services offer a unique metaverse gaming experience via the Game
                            and other related experiences through the combination of traditional core game and blockchain
                            mechanics via the Ethereum blockchain (the “<strong>Bionic Owls Metaverse</strong>”). The Bionic Owls Metaverse

                            is driven by a token system $BOWLS. $BOWLS serves as the native in-Game currency used for in-
                            Game economic interactions, and is deployed as a governance token for influencing decision making

                            regarding the Bionic Owls Metaverse by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where the
                            $BOWLS token is staked (the “<strong>Bionic Owls DAO</strong>”). The Bionic Owls DAO governs certain aspects of
                            the Bionic Owls Metaverse; we do not control the Bionic Owls DAO and are not responsible for its
                            decisions or actions. You acknowledge and agree that we cannot be held liable or responsible in any
                            way for any damages or losses incurred by any person in connection with any acts or omissions of the
                            Bionic Owls DAO. Further details on the Bionic Owls Metaverse, including the uses of $BOWLS, are
                            set forth in the Bionic Owls whitepaper, as we may update from time to time.

                            1.2 <strong>DAOs</strong>. The Bionic Owls Metaverse utilizes a guild system that allows you to create factions and
                            collectives that operate in a decentralized, autonomous way (“<strong>Decentralized Autonomous
                            Organisations</strong>”). The Services may provide you and other players with certain tools that enable the
                            implementation and management of such Decentralized Autonomous Organisations. We reserve the
                            right to revoke access from any Decentralized Autonomous Organisation, or member player thereof, to
                            such tools in the event that such Decentralized Autonomous Organisation or player violates these Terms
                            or for any other reason we determine in our good faith business judgment.

                            1.3 <strong>Game Items</strong>. The Services provide a marketplace (the “<strong>Marketplace</strong>”) for you to purchase, transfer,
                            and trade Game-related items and other items (“<strong>Game Items</strong>”). Game Items can be used in the Services
                            in various ways that we or the Bionic Owls DAO make available, such as to represent in-Game assets
                            that you can use while you play the Game. We make no promises or guarantees regarding the
                            functionality, utility, or value of any Game Items, and such Game Items may evolve and change as we
                            or the Bionic Owls DAO update and modify the Game and the Bionic Owls Metaverse.

                            1.4 <strong>Game NFTs</strong>. Your purchase of Game Items may be accompanied by non-fungible tokens (“<strong>NFTs</strong>”),
                            and your ownership of these NFTs is tracked via the Ethereum blockchain (“<strong>Game NFTs</strong>”). Your
                            ownership of these Game NFTs will give you certain rights and privileges within the Services, for as
                            long as we make the Services and such rights and privileges available to you. You are responsible for
                            all payments, fees, and costs when engaging in any transactions involving Game NFTs, including,
                            without limitation, the purchase price, transaction fees, fees associated with your secondary or
                            subsequent sales of Game NFTs, and all other fees associated with your use of the Game NFTs via the
                            Services.

                            1.5 Marketplace. We provide the Marketplace to be able to sell Game Items and other Services-related

                            offerings (collectively, “<strong>Offerings</strong>”) to you directly from us. The Marketplace will also facilitate peer-
                            to-peer sales conducted via decentralized or third-party exchanges or protocols whereby buyers and

                            sellers can buy, sell, and trade Game NFTs with each other. We may charge a transaction fee on all
                            peer-to-peer sales that occur via the Marketplace or that otherwise involve Game NFTs (which may be
                            calculated as a percentage of the overall sale price of the Game Items). We may offer ways to receive a
                            discount on such transaction fees, such as by holding or staking certain Services-related tokens and
                            assets. The scope of, and pre-requisitions for receiving any, such discount offers are subject to change
                            by us in our sole discretion at any time. To facilitate transactions via the Marketplace, we have integrated
                            with one or more third-party exchanges and services, such as the Serum exchange protocol, or other
                            decentralized smart contract protocols. These protocols facilitate the exchange of cryptocurrency and
                            other assets through the Ethereum blockchain. We do not own or control these third-party or

                            Linking a Digital Wallet to the Services is required to be able to purchase, store, and engage in

                            items from one Digital Wallet to another, such transfers will occur on the public blockchain and we

                            if the arbitrator concludes that doing so would be appropriate under the circumstances. Any in-person
                            appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration
                            of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such
                            determination should be made by the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitration shall be deemed to
                            take place in New York, and any resulting award(s) will be rendered in New York, regardless of the location
                            or method of any hearings.
